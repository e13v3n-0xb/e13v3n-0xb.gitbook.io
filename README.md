Hi Guys! :wave:

My pen name is E13V3N :purple\_heart:. I am a newbie in the RE and Malware field and starting to learn more about it.

It's a personal blog where I will be writing about some CTFs writeup, malware analysis, and the things I will learn while exploring this field. Anything posted here is my own work and is not affiliated with any company that I work/worked for.

I hope this blog will turn out useful for you. :sparkles:

Feel free to give any suggestions/feedback/corrections.
